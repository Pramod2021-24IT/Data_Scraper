## 1)	INTRODUCTION

In the age of information, data is a valuable resource. The Data Scraper project aims to automate the extraction of data from websites, allowing users to gather information efficiently and effectively. This project leverages web scraping techniques to collect, process, and store data from various online sources, providing an essential tool for businesses, researchers, and individuals.

## 2)	OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to develop a data scraper that can:

## 3)	BACKGROUND
Web scraping involves programmatically extracting information from websites. It is widely used in various fields, including market research, data analysis, and content aggregation. Python, with its powerful libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests, is an ideal choice for implementing web scraping due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
The Data Scraper project leverages Flask, a lightweight web framework, to create a user-friendly interface for inputting URLs and selecting data types to extract. This project provides a comprehensive solution for automating data extraction tasks, thereby saving time and resources.
